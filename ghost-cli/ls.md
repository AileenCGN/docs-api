The `ghost ls` command lists all Ghost sites and their status âœ…

The command reads information about installed instances from the `~/.ghost/config` file. This is useful if you can't remember where you installed a particular instance of Ghost, or are working with multiple instances (local, production, staging and so on). 

Call this command from anywhere ðŸ˜Ž
